# Reproduction guide (archived)

This file previously contained a detailed step-by-step reproduction guide. The repository's reproduction instructions and examples have been consolidated into the primary docs:

- `README.md` — Quick start, results summary and pointers
- `docs/SETUP.md` — Installation, verification, example config files and troubleshooting

If you need the original long-form reproduction steps, they were merged into the above files. Keep this file as an archive pointer to the consolidated documentation.

Recommended next steps:

- Follow the Quick Start in `README.md` to bootstrap an environment.
- Use `docs/SETUP.md` for environment-specific setup, config examples and validation commands.
- If you want the full, original guide restored as a separate artifact, tell me and I will recreate it as `docs/REPRODUCTION_GUIDE_ARCHIVE.md`.
