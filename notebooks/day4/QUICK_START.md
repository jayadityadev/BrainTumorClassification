# 🚀 Day 4 - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ **Day 4 Setup Complete!**

All notebooks and modules are ready. Here's how to proceed:

---

## 📋 What Was Created

### **Python Modules:**
✅ `src/modeling/__init__.py` - Module initialization  
✅ `src/modeling/data_generator.py` - Data augmentation generators  
✅ `src/modeling/model_cnn.py` - CNN architecture builder  

### **Day 4 Notebooks:**
✅ `day4_01_callbacks_setup.ipynb` - Training callbacks (~5 min)  
✅ `day4_02_full_training.ipynb` - Full training (~10 min) **← MAIN**  
✅ `day4_03_evaluation.ipynb` - Test evaluation (~10 min)  
✅ `day4_04_ablation_study.ipynb` - Original vs Enhanced (~30 min)  
✅ `day4_05_gradcam_visualization.ipynb` - Interpretability (~20 min) **[OPTIONAL]**

## 🎯 Recommended Execution Order

### **Minimum Path (Core Training):**
```bash
cd /projects/ai-ml/BrainTumorProject

# 1. Full training (MUST DO)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_02_full_training.ipynb

# 2. Evaluation (MUST DO)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_03_evaluation.ipynb
```

**Time:** ~20 minutes  
**Output:** Trained model + test set results

---

### **Complete Path (All Analyses):**
```bash
cd /projects/ai-ml/BrainTumorProject

# 1. Test callbacks (optional but recommended)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_01_callbacks_setup.ipynb

# 2. Full training (REQUIRED)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_02_full_training.ipynb

# 3. Test evaluation (REQUIRED)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_03_evaluation.ipynb

# 4. Ablation study (recommended)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_04_ablation_study.ipynb

# 5. Grad-CAM (optional - for interpretability)
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_05_gradcam_visualization.ipynb
```

**Time:** ~75 minutes  
**Output:** Complete Day 4 deliverables

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### **Start Jupyter:**
```bash
cd /projects/ai-ml/BrainTumorProject
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/
```

### **Or run specific notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/day4/day4_02_full_training.ipynb
```

## 📊 Expected Results

| Notebook | Duration | Key Output |
|----------|----------|------------|
| 01 - Callbacks | 5 min | Verified callback setup |
| 02 - Training | 10 min | `model_cnn_best.h5` (78-85% val acc) |
| 03 - Evaluation | 10 min | Confusion matrix, metrics |
| 04 - Ablation | 30 min | Enhancement impact (+5-10%) |
| 05 - Grad-CAM | 20 min | Visual explanations |

## 🎯 What You'll Achieve Today

By end of Day 4, you will have:

✅ **Fully trained CNN model** with 78-85% validation accuracy  
✅ **Best model saved** at `outputs/models/model_cnn_best.h5`  
✅ **Test set evaluation** with confusion matrix and metrics  
✅ **Quantified enhancement impact** through ablation study  
✅ **Model interpretability** with Grad-CAM visualizations  
✅ **Complete documentation** of all experiments

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If GPU out of memory:**
```python
# Add to first cell of notebook:
import tensorflow as tf
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
```

### **If training is slow:**
- Use GPU if available
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE = 16` (from 32)
- Reduce `EPOCHS = 8` (for quick test)

### **If imports fail:**
```bash
# Verify virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```
