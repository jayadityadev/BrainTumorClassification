## 📊 Expected Timeline

### Full Execution (3-4 hours with GPU):
```
⏱️  EfficientNetB0:  60 min  [Start here]
⏱️  ResNet50:        90 min  [Longest]

## 🚨 Important Notes

### GPU Memory:
- Monitor with `nvidia-smi`
- If OOM, reduce batch size to 16
- Run models one at a time

### Model Saving:
- All models auto-save with timestamps
- Best weights restored on early stopping
- Ensemble auto-finds latest models

### Training Time:
- Estimates are for GTX 1650 Mobile
- Your GPU may be faster/slower
- CPU training NOT recommended (10-20 hours)

## 🎯 Next Action

**You have 2 options:**

### Option 1: Read First, Execute Later
```bash
# Read the comprehensive guide
cat DAY4_ADVANCED_GUIDE.md

# Read the quick reference
cat DAY4_ADVANCED_QUICKSTART.md

# Then execute when ready
```

### Option 2: Execute Now
```
1. Open notebooks/day4/day4_advanced_01_efficientnet.ipynb
2. Run all cells (Ctrl+Shift+Enter in VS Code)
3. Wait ~60 minutes for training
4. Check results (should see 88-92% accuracy)
5. Move to next notebook
