## 🐛 Common Issues (And Solutions)

### **Issue 1: Training stuck at 33% accuracy**

**Why:** Model not learning (weights not updating properly)

**Solutions:**
- Check learning rate (try 0.0001 or 0.01)
- Verify data generators are working
- Ensure labels are correct

### **Issue 2: Overfitting (train 95%, val 65%)**

**Why:** Model memorizing training data

**Solutions:**
- Already handled! (Dropout, BatchNorm, Augmentation)
- Increase dropout rate to 0.6
- Add more augmentation

### **Issue 3: Training very slow**

**Why:** Running on CPU instead of GPU

**Solutions:**
- Check: `nvidia-smi` (should show GPU)
- Use Google Colab (free GPU)
- Reduce batch size to 16
- Be patient (CPU works, just slower)

---

## 📞 Quick Help

### **Before Training:**
```bash
# Check everything is ready
ls outputs/data_splits/*_split.csv  # Should show 3 files
source .venv/bin/activate           # Activate environment
python -c "import tensorflow"       # Check TensorFlow
```

### **During Training:**
- ✅ Loss decreasing = good
- ✅ Accuracy increasing = good
- ✅ Val_accuracy close to train_accuracy = good
- ❌ Loss increasing = problem
- ❌ Val_accuracy much lower than train = overfitting

### **After Training:**
```bash
# Check model saved
ls -lh outputs/models/

# Check results
cat outputs/training_history/*.json | grep accuracy

# View visualizations
ls outputs/visualizations/day4_*
```
